# AGENTS.md

IMPORTANT: Keep all agent guidance in this file. DO NOT CREATE ANY VENDOR- OR MODE-SPECIFIC FILES IF THEY NOT ALREADY EXIST.

This file provides guidance to agents when working with code in this repository.

## Build/Test Commands

- CLI: `cd cli && cargo build/test/run`
- Daemon: `cd daemon && cargo build/test/run`
- Container: `cd daemon && make container` (uses podman by default, override with `CONTAINER_TOOL=docker`)
- Run single test: `cargo test test_name` (from cli/ or daemon/ directory)

## Non-Obvious Project Patterns

- Daemon requires Linux systems (apt-pkg-native dependency fails on other platforms)
- Uses mDNS service discovery with "_cobbler._tcp.local." service type for automatic daemon discovery
- Environment variables control daemon configuration: COBBLER_DAEMON_PORT (default 8080), COBBLER_DAEMON_HOSTNAME, COBBLER_DAEMON_IP, COBBLER_DAEMON_API_KEY
- COBBLER_TIMEOUT env var accepts both seconds (integer) or humantime format (e.g., "1m", "30s")
- Daemon runs 'apt-get update' on every status check (not cached) - see get_apt_updates()
- CLI uses blocking HTTP client (reqwest with blocking feature) while daemon uses async Axum framework
- Different Rust editions: CLI uses 2021, daemon uses 2024
- Container builds use podman with ports 8080 (HTTP) and 5353 (mDNS)
- Daemon auto-hunts for free port starting from 8080 if COBBLER_DAEMON_PORT not set
- API authentication uses X-API-Key header (not Authorization header)
- If no API key provided, daemon generates UUID v4 and logs it

## Project Coding Rules (Non-Obvious Only)

- Use mDNS service registration patterns from daemon/src/main.rs for service discovery
- Linux-specific conditional compilation with #[cfg(target_os = "linux")] for apt functionality
- CLI uses blocking HTTP client (reqwest with blocking feature) while daemon uses async
- Service discovery timeout handling with flume channels (see cli/src/main.rs discover_targets)
- TabWriter for formatted CLI output with custom padding (2 spaces)
- IPv6 addresses in URLs must be wrapped in brackets: `http://[::1]:8080` (see resolve_url function)
- mDNS instance name format: "cobblerd-{hostname}" where hostname is first part before dot
- Daemon uses AtomicBool for is_upgrading state to prevent concurrent upgrades
- Full upgrade spawns tokio task and returns immediately (fire-and-forget pattern)

## Project Debug Rules (Non-Obvious Only)

- mDNS service registration failures logged with detailed error messages in daemon
- Linux-specific apt functionality debugging requires Debian-based system
- Container networking requires ports 8080 (HTTP) and 5353 (mDNS) to be exposed
- Daemon status endpoint provides JSON response with update details
- Tests use #[cfg(target_os = "macos")] to handle platform-specific behavior
- CLI discover command uses HashSet to deduplicate services by fullname

## Project Documentation Rules (Non-Obvious Only)

- CLI discovers daemons via mDNS, daemon serves status via HTTP API
- Daemon only runs on Linux (Debian-based systems with apt)
- Environment variables configure daemon networking and identity
- REST and web components are planned but not yet implemented (empty directories)
- Container builds require both HTTP (8080) and mDNS (5353) ports

## Project Architecture Rules (Non-Obvious Only)

- Multi-component system: CLI discovers via mDNS, daemon serves HTTP status API
- Daemon architecture requires Linux (Debian-based) for apt package management
- Environment-based configuration replaces traditional config files
- mDNS service discovery enables automatic cluster discovery
- Container architecture requires both HTTP and mDNS networking
- Daemon uses middleware pattern for authentication (auth_middleware)
- Status handler returns 412 PRECONDITION_FAILED on non-Debian systems
